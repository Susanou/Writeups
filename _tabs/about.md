Game developer at Ankama. Working on network and security for Dofus.

I have created multiple games using the Unity Engine. Also created the framework for 3D experiences in Unity and converted them to a 2D environment using Paper JS.

I'm passionate about games, AI and security and specialize in cryptography for CTF hacking competitions.
