I’m a French student at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH in Computer Science. I’m interested in cryptography, Capture The Flag, AI, and particularly adversarial Machine Learning algorithms.

I’m majoring with a depth in Networks and Security and minors in both video game design and Japanese. Currently working on my Mater project developing an algorithm for federated learning that could mitigate GAN attacks.
