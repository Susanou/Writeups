I’m a French student at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland OH in Computer Science. I’m interested in cryptography, Capture The Flag, AI, and particularly adversarial Machine Learning algorithms.

I’m majoring with a depth in Networks and Security and minors in both video game design and Japanese. I’m currently working with Dr. Ray on an experiment on AI assistants in motor learning using Unity and OpenHaptics. The goal is to test whether AI assistants have an effect on our performance.
