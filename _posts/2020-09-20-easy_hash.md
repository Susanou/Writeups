# Easy Hash (easy)

## Given file and prompt

```
Source Code: easy_hash.7z
Web Server: https://crypto01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo

For beginners: you can use curl to interact with the web server.

(Example)
$  curl https://crypto01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo -d 'twctf: hello 2020'
```

```python
import struct
import os

MSG = b'twctf: please give me the flag of 2020'

assert os.environ['FLAG']

def easy_hash(x):
    m = 0
    for i in range(len(x) - 3):
        m += struct.unpack('<I', x[i:i + 4])[0]
        m = m & 0xffffffff

    return m

def index(request):
    message = request.get_data()
    if message[0:7] != b'twctf: ' or message[-4:] != b'2020':
        return b'invalid message format: ' + message

    if message == MSG:
        return b'dont cheet'

    msg_hash = easy_hash(message)
    expected_hash = easy_hash(MSG)
    if msg_hash == expected_hash:
        return 'Congrats! The flag is ' + "HERE IS THE FLAG"
    return 'Failed: easy_hash({}) is {}. but expected value is {}.'.format(message, msg_hash, expected_hash)
```

## Approach

I had two approach to this:

- Like MD5, possibly trying to find a collision of the hash (the desired value was `1788732187`)
- Finding a character that wouldn't change the hash

### Finding a colision

I tried first to brute force this using the same method as MD5 collision but this took too long and I abandoned.
While I do believe that there is a string that will collide and equal the one that we want in value, there was a faster approach.

### A character that wont affect the hash

The function to calculate the hash is the following: 

```python
def easy_hash(x):
    m = 0
    for i in range(len(x) - 3):
        m += struct.unpack('<I', x[i:i + 4])[0]
        m = m & 0xffffffff

    return m
```

It takes a window of 4 characters and unpacks their value with `little endian` and `unsigned integer` and sums them all to mod `0xffffffff`. Our goal is to then add one character that would have value of `0` when its unpacked. We can reverse this by using:

```python
import struct
struct.pack('<I', 0) #==> b'\x00\x00\x00\x00'
```

Thus adding the character `\x00` to the string `b'twctf: please give me the flag of 2020'` would make it different from the message while retaining the hash. 

## Solution

Using the python command line:

```python
import requests

r = requests.post('https://crypto01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo', data=b'twctf: please give me the flag of \x002020')  
print(r.text) # 'Congrats! The flag is TWCTF{colorfully_decorated_dream}'
```

## Flag

'Congrats! The flag is TWCTF{colorfully_decorated_dream}'
